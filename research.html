          <h3>Research</h3>
          <p>The area of research that immediately contributes to my work is in developmental epistemology of music, emotion in music, perception of tonal organization in music, musical synesthesia, and perception of rhythm, meter, and tempo.</p>
          <p>However, I have always been interested in laying out a comprehensive theory of general music semiotics, similar to "general linguistics" by Ferdinand de Saussure, that would integrate the data coming from history of Western music, comparative ethnomusicology, sociology of music, and cognitive sciences, in order to establish such features of communication that are typical for all types of music.</p>
          <p>More recently, I started looking into the issue of globalization of music and the current state of music in dustry. This led me to the investigation of the histor of popular music, history of folk music, ,and history od development of the music market.</p>
          <p>In 2014 I decided to start publishing some of my finding and looking for their critical evaluation by experts in the field. I believe that integration of many disciplines and apporaches to music coming from, both, the West and the East, would allow to throw light on the formative role that music has played in the cognitive development of humanity.</p>
          <p>Below, are short summaries and links to some of my research material.</p>

          <h3>Research</h3>
        </a>
        <p>While interested in the scientific investigation of music, I look at music primarily as a composer: as to how the meaningful strucural elemnts of music are put together in order to express a particular idea (emotional state, imagery, attitude, etc.). In this quest, I am interested in all kinds of music: from folk to popular, and from historic to modern classical. I look at all music through the prism of music theory, history, pyschology, anthropology, and sociology.</p>

          <h3>Compositions</h3>
        </a>
        <p>I started out as a modernistic composer. However, having discovered limitations of modernism and post-modernism, I set out to explore the music popular and folk types. Having realized that music operates in a siimilar way to language, I came to see that the approach of Baroque composers generally right: one has to define the lexicon and the grammer of music before proceeding to execute its main function - the expression of emotions.</p>

          <h3>Music Credo</h3>
        </a>
        <p>I believe that we live at a ciritical historical time where unprecendented technical achievements have made it possible for anyone to make himself heard. This has long-established conventions, thereby, eroding the order that had brought our civilization to where it is today Our challenege, therefore, is to find a way to reconnect to our roots so that the broken bloodline of our heritage restores its function and begins to distribute the nourishment we, as a human culture, are severaly starved for.</p>
