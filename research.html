          <h3>Research</h3>
          <p>The area of research that immediately contributes to my work is in developmental epistemology of music, emotion in music, perception of tonal organization in music, musical synesthesia, and perception of rhythm, meter, and tempo.</p>
          <p>However, I have always been interested in laying out a comprehensive theory of general music semiotics, similar to "general linguistics" by Ferdinand de Saussure, that would integrate the data coming from history of Western music, comparative ethnomusicology, sociology of music, and cognitive sciences, in order to establish such features of communication that are typical for all types of music.</p>
          <p>More recently, I started looking into the issue of globalization of music and the current state of music in dustry. This led me to the investigation of the histor of popular music, history of folk music, ,and history od development of the music market.</p>
          <p>In 2014 I decided to start publishing some of my finding and looking for their critical evaluation by experts in the field. I believe that integration of many disciplines and apporaches to music coming from, both, the West and the East, would allow to throw light on the formative role that music has played in the cognitive development of humanity.</p>
          <p>Below, are short summaries and links to some of my research material.</p>

          <h4>Blind Buy: Do We Consume Music, or Does Music Consume Us?</h4>
        </a>
        <p>In an attempt to provide an answer for why it is important to understand music as a language of emotions, I provide a historic overview into the way in which music was used to influence a person’s mental and physiological state, in Western civilization. I examine the rather newly held belief formed in the mid 20th century perceiving music to “enhance” one’s wellbeing while neglecting to consider that certain kinds of music can in fact be “harmful”. Possible political, social, and cultural causes for such of these ways of thinking are discussed.</p>

          <h4>Can Music Hurt? - Music and Violence</h4>
        </a>
        <p>Here, I attempt to resolve an almost half a century old debate about ethos in music, and its relation to the individual as well as the social group, on the one hand, and the extent of their freedom of artistic expression, on the other. I draw a perspective view on the connection between violence in music and violence in society, and the causes for the persistent denial of ties between the two that characterizes public consensus and music scholars of today.</p>

          <h4>Evolution of Music Market: How Western Music Canon Relates to Westernization of the World</h4>
        </a>
        <p>The purpose of this paper is to put into perspective the position of Western classical music tradition in the world. It corrects a number of inaccuracies in how modern scholars view the Westernization of World music. The paper then proceeds to identify the key notions that distinguish Western music from music of the rest of the world. It examines the role of Western popular music in Westernization of world music, and identifies the contribution of Western classical music to this process.</p>

          <h4>Evolution of Tonal Organization in Music Mirrors Symbolic Representation of Perceptual Reality – Part 1: Prehistoric</h4>
        </a>
        <p>This paper presents a view into the pre-history of music using the most recent resources and information on biology, ethnomusicology, music sociology, archeology, and psychoacoustics. In doing so, I attempt to reinitiate the line of research in comparative ethnomusicology that was interrupted after the 1960s in the West. Also, I identify and trace the emergence of two alternative methods of tonal organization of music, each cultivating a different worldview.</p>

          <h4>Evolution of Tonal Organization in Music Optimizes Neural Mechanisms in Symbolic Encoding of Perceptual Reality. Part 2: Ancient to 17th century</h4>
        </a>
        <p>This paper brings to light the way in which musical pitch, as a peculiar form of cognition, is reflective of the organization of the surrounding world. It establishes the connection between the tonal organization in music and the spatial organization in pictorial art, and tracks the origin of both in the environmental topography. Stages of tonal organization and typologies of musical texture are compared in defining the overall course of tonal evolution from prehistoric times to the 17th century.</p>

          <h4>How Emotion Can Be the Meaning of a Music Work</h4>
        </a>
        <p>In this paper I lay out the foundation for a new semiotics of music – one that is in line with the most up-to-date research on neurophysiology of emotion. I show how the traditional view of music as a “language of emotions,” which prevailed up until the 20th century, can hold true in relation to perception of music.</p>

          <h4>How Many Musical Canons Does Western Music Have?: Recent Trends In Canonization vs. De-Canonization</h4>
        </a>
        <p>Recent explosion of publications critical of Western classical music canon, specifically accusing it of Europocentricity and retrogression, provoked me to write this paper. In it, I address the absurdity of attempts made by a number of scholars who have formulated some artificially conceived canons as an alternative to the existing ones in relation to classical music, justifying their “de-canonization” of what appears to them as vestige of old tradition as a inventive and necessary act, yet, not surprisingly, to no avail.</p>

          <h4>Listeners’ Canon in Western Music: Secret of “Conservatism” of Public Taste and its Ramifications on the Music Industry</h4>
        </a>
        <p>In exploring the phenomenon of canonization of composers and their works by the general public as fixed through the interaction of professional criticism, music education, journalism and later, music record and radio broadcasting within the Western cultural establishment, I demonstrate the futility of attempts whether to revise the existing canons or to introduce new ones. I show that no matter how hard the artistic and educational institutions try to push their agenda on the public, the public nonetheless continues to dearly hold on to its old time favorites. The roots of this problem are examined in light of cultural mismanagement of music by the record industry and the cultural and educational institutions. Its ramifications are discussed in relation to, both, classical and popular music.</p>

          <h4>Musical Idiom vs. Technical Device in Composition: A Semiotic Perspective</h4>
        </a>
        <p>The discussion here is about the difference between “technique” of composition and what is usually referred to as “topoi” in American musicology. The paper traces the distinction between the organization of sound into meaningful conventional patterns, and the manner in which a composition is organized technically, during different historic periods. It then points to the necessity to introduce the notion of “musical idiom” as a requirement for comparative study of expression across different historic periods and techniques.</p>

          <h4>Non-Communicative Music Grammars of the 20th Century</h4>
        </a>
        <p>This paper touches upon the very sensitive issue of “experimental music,” with its absence of conventions, as it is usually defined in relation to the 20th century music. The history of such music is traced. Afterward, the focus shifts to its non-communicative design that seems to unite all the different techniques it implements as well as ways to tell it apart from music that is conventional and communicative. The ramifications of such non-communicative music for performers and musicologists are examined, which then raises the question of how necessary it actually is to study such works.</p>

          <h4>Performance Canon in Western Music: Ideologies of Conventional, Avant-Garde, and Authentic Music</h4>
        </a>
        <p>This is an extensive overview of the performance practice, with the purpose to demonstrate that the recent attempts of “canonization” characterize not only Western compositions, but also performance standards. I hold that canonization should be viewed as an organic property that organizes any market, since once a music product is placed on the market, the canonic hierarchy begins to form based on the supply/demand interaction.</p>

          <h4>Possession Is Nine Tenths of the Law: The Story of Jazz and Intellectual Property</h4>
        </a>
        <p>In this paper, I set to build a case that the American copyright laws are the main cause of pushing Jazz, once the bloodline of American music, out of it birthplace and in the way of oblivion. Cross-examination of data coming from musicology, sociology, and legal and economic studies points to the way in which bad copyright laws led to bad practices of law enforcement, which in turn, promoted bad business practices leading to the general public’s loss of interest in this previously vital art.</p>

          <h4>Syntax: Music that Makes Sense and Music that Doesn’t</h4>
        </a>
        <p>In this paper I analyze the process of music comprehension, and argue that the primary mode of comprehending music is hierarchically driven from bottom-up, and that it is based on parsing the flow of music into idiomatic units. I thus propose the necessity for a major update to the established semiotic theory of Lerdahl/Jackendoff.</p>

          <h4>20th Century: Meter vs Rhythm</h4>
        </a>
        <p>My focus in this paper is in evaluating the role of meter in shaping rhythm and its contribution to music expression. I expand on some of the problems related to the tendency in the 20th century to reduce the metric function in music. I also define the fundamental contradiction between the avant-garde composer’s intention and the listener’s perception. In so doing, I conclude that in order to study the 20th century music on scientific grounds, there is no alternative but to prioritize meter over rhythm.</p>
